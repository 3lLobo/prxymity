Human: Answer the user's question as best you can:
You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json
{"type":"object","properties":{"insights":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"alertIds":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"The alert IDs that the insight is based on."},"detailsMarkdown":{"type":"string","description":"A detailed insight with markdown, where each markdown bullet contains a description of what happened that reads like a story of the attack as it played out and always uses special {{ field.name fieldValue1 fieldValue2 fieldValueN }} syntax for field names and values from the source data. Examples of CORRECT syntax (includes field names and values): {{ host.name hostNameValue }} {{ user.name userNameValue }} {{ source.ip sourceIpValue }} Examples of INCORRECT syntax (bad, because the field names are not included): {{ hostNameValue }} {{ userNameValue }} {{ sourceIpValue }}"},"entitySummaryMarkdown":{"type":"string","description":"A short (no more than a sentence) summary of the insight featuring only the host.name and user.name fields (when they are applicable), using the same {{ field.name fieldValue1 fieldValue2 fieldValueN }} syntax"},"mitreAttackTactics":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"An array of MITRE ATT&CK tactic for the insight, using one of the following values: Reconnaissance,Initial Access,Execution,Persistence,Privilege Escalation,Discovery,Lateral Movement,Command and Control,Exfiltration"},"summaryMarkdown":{"type":"string","description":"A markdown summary of insight, using the same {{ field.name fieldValue1 fieldValue2 fieldValueN }} syntax"},"title":{"type":"string","description":"A short, no more than 7 words, title for the insight, NOT formatted with special syntax or markdown. This must be as brief as possible."}},"required":["alertIds","detailsMarkdown","summaryMarkdown","title"],"additionalProperties":false},"description":"Insights with markdown that always uses special {{ field.name fieldValue1 fieldValue2 fieldValueN }} syntax for field names and values from the source data. Examples of CORRECT syntax (includes field names and values): {{ host.name hostNameValue }} {{ user.name userNameValue }} {{ source.ip sourceIpValue }} Examples of INCORRECT syntax (bad, because the field names are not included): {{ hostNameValue }} {{ userNameValue }} {{ sourceIpValue }}"}},"required":["insights"],"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

You are a cyber security analyst tasked with analyzing security events from Elastic Security to identify and report on potential cyber attacks or progressions. Your report should focus on high-risk incidents that could severely impact the organization, rather than isolated alerts. Present your findings in a way that can be easily understood by anyone, regardless of their technical expertise, as if you were briefing the CISO. Break down your response into sections based on timing, hosts, and users involved. When correlating alerts, use kibana.alert.original_time when it's available, otherwise use @timestamp. Include appropriate context about the affected hosts and users. Describe how the attack progression might have occurred and, if feasible, attribute it to known threat groups. Prioritize high and critical alerts, but include lower-severity alerts if desired. In the description field, provide as much detail as possible, in a bulleted list explaining any attack progressions. Accuracy is of utmost importance. You MUST escape all JSON special characters (i.e. backslashes, double quotes, newlines, tabs, carriage returns, backspaces, and form feeds).

Use context from the following alerts to provide insights:
