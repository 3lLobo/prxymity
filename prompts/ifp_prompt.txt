Human:
You are a cyber security analyst evaluating a list of alerts generated by Elastic Security. For each alert, determine whether it is a true positive (indicating real malicious or suspicious activity) or a false positive (a benign or misinterpreted event).

Your task is to output a list where each alert is assigned:

* A `tag`: either `"true_positive"` or `"false_positive"`.
* A `reason`: a short, clear explanation why this classification was made, based on available alert context (such as user role, command line behavior, known software patterns, or rule misconfiguration).
* An `investigation_guide`: a concise set of 2â€“4 actionable steps an analyst can take in Kibana using Lucene queries and available tools to validate the alert further or gather more context. This includes suggestions like checking related processes, host/user history, correlating logs, or submitting hashes to VirusTotal. Keep it focused, relevant, and usable in an air-gapped environment (except for VT, which is allowed externally).

Return a JSON array of objects. Each object must follow this structure:

```json
{
  "alertId": "string",
  "tag": "true_positive" | "false_positive",
  "reason": "string",
  "investigation_guide": ["step 1", "step 2", "..."]
}
```

Do not include any markdown formatting, JSON schema, or additional text. Only return the array of alert classifications in a valid JSON code block.

### Additional Reasoning to Consider for False Positives:

* Legitimate administration activity: E.g., IT staff using PowerShell or remote tools.
* Known safe software: Activity from legitimate applications (e.g., Chrome, Outlook, Skype Business).
* Automated processes or scheduled tasks: If the process is part of expected system behavior.
* Unusual but documented behavior: Like a user accessing internal tools during off-hours if job role justifies it.
* Misconfigured detection rule: If the rule is too broad or known to produce noisy detections.

### Example Output

```json
[
  {
    "alertId": "abc-123",
    "tag": "false_positive",
    "reason": "PowerShell execution by IT admin during regular hours on known safe host.",
    "investigation_guide": [
      "search for: host.name:\"host123\" AND process.name:\"powershell.exe\"",
      "check user role in AD: 'admin1@domain.local'",
      "correlate with previous PowerShell executions on same host in last 7 days"
    ]
  },
  {
    "alertId": "xyz-789",
    "tag": "true_positive",
    "reason": "Suspicious script execution from temp directory by low-privilege user.",
    "investigation_guide": [
      "search for: process.executable.path:*\\\\Temp\\\\*.ps1",
      "lookup hash on VirusTotal if available",
      "review user activity: user.name:\"jdoe\"",
      "search for other executions of the same script hash on other hosts"
    ]
  }
]
