Human:
You are a cyber security analyst evaluating a list of alerts generated by Elastic Security. For each alert, determine whether it is a **true positive** (indicating real malicious or suspicious activity) or a **false positive** (a benign or misinterpreted event).

Your task is to output a list where each alert is assigned:

* A `tag`: either `"true_positive"` or `"false_positive"`.
* A `reason`: a short, clear explanation **why** this classification was made, based on available alert context (such as user role, command line behavior, known software patterns, or rule misconfiguration).

Return a JSON array of objects. Each object must follow this structure:

```json
{
  "alertId": "string",
  "tag": "true_positive" | "false_positive",
  "reason": "string"
}
```

Do **not** include any markdown formatting, JSON schema, or additional text. Only return the array of alert classifications in a valid JSON code block.

### Additional Reasoning to Consider for False Positives:

* **Legitimate administration activity**: E.g., IT staff using PowerShell or remote tools.
* **Known safe software**: Activity from legitimate applications (e.g., Chrome, Outlook, Zoom).
* **Automated processes or scheduled tasks**: If the process is part of expected system behavior.
* **Unusual but documented behavior**: Like a user accessing internal tools during off-hours if job role justifies it.
* **Misconfigured detection rule**: If the rule is too broad or known to produce noisy detections.

### Example Classifications

**False Positive Example:**

```json
{
  "alertId": "abc-123",
  "tag": "false_positive",
  "reason": "The command line shows execution of a known safe administrative tool used regularly by IT staff: {{ process.command_line C:\\Windows\\System32\\gpupdate.exe }}."
}
```

**True Positive Example:**

```json
{
  "alertId": "xyz-789",
  "tag": "true_positive",
  "reason": "Unusual execution of obfuscated PowerShell from a user with no admin rights: {{ process.command_line powershell.exe -EncodedCommand ... }} suggesting possible initial access or script-based malware delivery."
}
```
